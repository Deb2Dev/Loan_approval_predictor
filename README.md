## 2. Overview

This project aims to build a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on six key features: the number of dependents, income, total assets, CIBIL score, loan term, and loan amount. By leveraging these features, the model helps financial institutions and loan officers make informed decisions about loan approvals.

## 3. Motivation

In the financial sector, loan approvals are crucial yet complex, often taking weeks to finalize. According to McKinsey, automating loan decisions can reduce processing time by up to 50% and improve approval accuracy by 20%. Traditional methods are prone to human error and bias, potentially leading to high default rates. This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to streamline the loan approval process, aiming to reduce risk and enhance efficiency. By leveraging machine learning, financial institutions can make faster, more accurate decisions, improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency while minimizing default risks.

## 4. Business Use Cases

It can be used by various financial institutions to streamline and reduce their time constraint of loan approval process.
